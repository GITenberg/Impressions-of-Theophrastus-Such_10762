description: Published in 1879, this is Eliot's last completed work, and perhaps her
  most underrated. It consists of a series of essays told by a nameless English bachelor.
  Though critics harshly judged the work as ponderous and moralizing" when it was
  published, today's readers will recognize Eliot's keen intelligence, sharp wit,
  and intriguing insights in such essays as A Too Deferential Man," A Political Molecule,"
  and Only Temper."
